Bejeweled 3

Please run the Test3D-clean.reg file for your version before running the patched game! It gets rid of any registry entries that might still be preventing the patch from working.

Choose the appropriate patch from the directory hierarchy, making sure to select the appropriate edition of the game and the appropriate version. If there are no patches present for an edition/version that you own you can try patches from the other editions/versions and see wether they work or leave a comment on YouTube with a link to your version of the game so I can take a look at it.

Suffixes explanations:
* original -> Unaltered file (no patches)
* nosig -> Avoids signature check failure errors
* vmem -> Patch for 'Not enough video memory.' FailureReason in registry
* vcard -> Patch for 'Unsupported video card: %s' Warning in registry

compat.cfg:
It appears as if for me the compat.cfg file is not required for High and Ultra resolution support. This might also be the case for you. If it is not, or if you want to make sure everything's going to work right from the start you can replace the original with this.

If you experience any other error than the ones patched above leave a comment on the video and I will try to investigate it when I have the time.
